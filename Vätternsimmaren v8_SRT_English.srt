Playlens film presents

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,000
A film by Tomas Hellberg

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,359
Andrzej Bednarski is

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,359
The Lake Vättern Swimmer

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,240
Varamoviken, Motala, July 1st 07:32
30 minutes until start

6
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,119
Thomas was already at the beach all set
So we started talking about the conditions

7
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:54,159
He was somewhat worried about the wind

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,679
The kayak was in place and we started packing

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,280
And then everything happened fast

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,439
We saw that the boat came closer to the beach

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,079
Everything went according to plan
We had planned to leave at 8

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,599
And I think that we were ready to go at 7:45
so I started to put on my gear

13
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,040
I've never been as close as now...

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,480
I can feel the pressure from everyone that has come

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,120
And then I think that I turned around
and waved to the people at the beach

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,240
And then I just went into the water
and right away I thought that this is not going to work

17
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,960
I felt that I will not be able to breathe

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,800
To swim in this cold for 30 km is impossible

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It was really strenuous

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,039
My face was the only part that was exposed to the cold

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,560
I couldn't catch my breath for the first 10 to 15 strokes
I felt unable to breathe

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,840
I said to myself: I can't quit now… I can't turn around and
tell everyone that we have to do it another day

23
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,599
It would be so silly to give up after 100 meters

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,479
So I just kept going
I felt too much pressure so I couldn't turn around

25
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,240
No matter what happens, I will keep going until...

26
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,919
Until it all stops

27
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,680
My name is Andrzej Bednarski
I am 42 years old

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,719
I was born in Poland

29
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,360
I grew up in France

30
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,560
I moved to France when I was 10 years old

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,879
But now I'm becoming more Swedish than French
as I've spent almost half of my life in Sweden now

32
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,080
I came to Sweden to finish my master's thesis

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,000
And it turned into 18 years...
So it turned out somewhat longer than planned

34
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,599
What do you think?
Will he make it?

35
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,919
This will be great!

36
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:54,039
The first 300 meters were very strenuous

37
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,280
And I kept thinking that I would not make it
But then the temperature got half a degree warmer

38
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,919
The wind came from the east and it is very typical
for the Varamon bay to drop in temperature

39
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,280
But slowly it got warmer
Half a degree makes a big difference

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
And I became more confident

41
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,840
I no longer felt unable to breathe

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,519
So I said to myself: Now we keep going

43
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,319
For the first five kilometers I just focused on
swimming to get warmer

44
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,959
The challenge is to attempt to swim from Karlsborg
to Motala across Lake Vättern

45
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,639
I dont’t think that is has ever been done before

46
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
At least not officially

47
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,240
I got the idea when I turned 40, like
a midlife crisis two years ago

48
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,600
And it is swimming 30 km in open water

49
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,800
It's pretty rough water

50
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,079
Lake Vättern can be really really rough

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,519
More like the open sea

52
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
Cold

53
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
What more to say?

54
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,920
I get goose bumps just thinking about it

55
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,079
It's a tough environment

56
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,279
The plan was to make a food stop once every hour

57
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,439
Food break at 1:02 hours and 4.1 kilometers

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
The lake is pretty nice

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,079
So far...

60
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,279
Do you want more biscuits?

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,800
So I forced myself to eat some and drink water

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,519
I took a break for maybe one minute

63
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,360
I never found a good position in the water for eating

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
I got some water in my face and
swallowed some water by accident

65
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,959
But the water is drinkable so not a problem

66
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,920
Then just continue to the next stop

67
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,439
Just keep going

68
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,000
June 28, 2017
Three days before start

69
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,439
The wind in Motala is often from the west

70
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,600
Which is why the idea originally was
to swim from Karlsborg to Motala

71
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,399
But it was obvious that the weather prognosis
was against us

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,480
And for many days the wind
came from the east

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,839
Which means that the water will be colder from the start

74
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Less waves

75
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,120
During this meeting we made the decision
to swim in the other direction

76
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,040
Especially because of the effort

77
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,680
Swimming in the same direction as the waves
is definitely easier than swimming against the waves

78
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:04,560
So we reversed the plan and made the decision
to swim from Motala to Karlsborg

79
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,399
Doing the same movements hour after hour

80
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,000
Like biking, walking or running

81
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,079
Riding a bike for a long time in the same position
can cause back pain

82
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,800
This is just like that
Doing the same movements for a long time

83
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,000
You will start to feel some pains that you
didn't anticipate at the start

84
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,439
Time is 1:43 hours

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,639
15 degrees in the water and climbing

86
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,360
Food break at 2:03 hours and 7.7 kilometers

87
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,559
After the bike race Vätternrundan the year before last
I started to swim quite much

88
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,039
Or quite often

89
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,960
I tried to swim every day

90
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Mixed intensity

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:08,519
I changed my swim style from high intensity intervals
to longer swims with lower intensity

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
Food break at 3:02 hours and 11.1 kilometers

93
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,480
He is not in over his head :-)

94
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,080
That joke was so bad that it was good

95
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,279
Soon after 10 kilometers we passed these islands

96
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,600
And then we had expected wind at 8 meters per second from the north

97
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,480
And the prognosis was almost spot on

98
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,000
As soon as we passed these islands
the waves got larger

99
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Vättern came alive

100
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,799
At the same time the water got slowly
warmer and warmer

101
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,320
Even the smallest change in temperature
makes a big difference when you are cold or at your limit

102
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,960
In a way, the lake was very kind to us
or me, in this case

103
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,799
Food break at 4:01 hours and 14.3 kilometers

104
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,039
Now we begin counting down

105
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,559
What?

106
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,559
Now we begin counting down

107
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,840
... food

108
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:09,679
What?

109
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,759
Do you want more food?

110
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,480
There is food for you
in the blue bag

111
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,000
Food break at 5:01 hours and 17.7 kilometers

112
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:53,399
They suggest doing food breaks every half hour
from here on

113
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
How is it Andrzej?

114
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,799
The lake is fantastic
No waves

115
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,440
Same direction as the waves
Really good

116
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,039
How much have you consumed? Where are you at?
50 %, 60 %, 70 %?

117
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,159
Of what?

118
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,799
Of your energy

119
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,039
I'm not sure

120
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Have some pain in my shoulders
but otherwise OK

121
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,600
I remember that around 15 kilometers during a food break

122
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,559
Thomas Thor asked me how I felt
and how much energy I had consumed

123
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,840
I didn't really want to answer as I wasn't sure

124
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,120
I know that it could change quickly
but I still felt quite good

125
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,639
My body felt fine and I needed food

126
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,679
As soon as I stopped I started freezing

127
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,799
I needed to quickly get going

128
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
My body felt good at half the distance

129
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Just go on for another hour

130
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,200
We are lucky to have two places to swim in Motala
One indoor and one outdoor

131
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,759
And then we train outdoors

132
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,879
It's a really good swimming pool
Many world-famous swimmers have trained in it

133
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,200
And swimming in a 50 meter pool is for me much better

134
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:19,759
I don't have to turn as often and can relax more
which is good when preparing for longer swims

135
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,879
Why break a winning concept?

136
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Food break at 5:32 hours and 19.4 kilometers

137
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,159
Food break at 6:02 hours and 21.3 kilometers

138
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,600
Here Markus

139
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Thanks

140
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,519
Take some of that gel

141
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,039
Where did the wind go?

142
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,559
Are you good?

143
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,240
Yes

144
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,440
Do you want more wind? :-)

145
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,559
The lake is like a mirror

146
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,559
Markus, can I get that sticky biscuit?

147
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,600
Yes, right

148
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,799
One of those gels left

149
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,839
Most of the swimming is done in pools of course

150
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
It gives best results

151
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,720
We have the opportunity to swim in the canal in Motala

152
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,240
Tuesdays and Thursdays
Twice per week to practice in the wetsuit

153
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,480
Look at all the zones where the wetsuit may cause irritation
and apply proper lubrication

154
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,119
It is very valuable

155
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Tomorrow...
No training Saturday and Sunday

156
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm away Saturday and Sunday
But Monday through Sunday next week we train all days

157
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,799
Maybe half a banana?

158
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,119
Time to feed the seal :-)

159
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,119
Not so far now

160
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Soon time to start to swim butterfly strokes

161
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Food break at 6:33 hours and 23.2 kilometers

162
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,119
Yes, butterfly

163
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,839
Over the finish line it's butterfly strokes

164
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,960
Aim to the right of that white beacon

165
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,960
The end of the grove

166
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,759
You see that white beacon?

167
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
To the right of that grove

168
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Right of the beacon?

169
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,119
To the right of that beacon straight ahead
is where we are going

170
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,400
How far?

171
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,480
Less than five

172
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Five kilometers?

173
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,559
Yes

174
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,799
Cramps?

175
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,759
Must not think

176
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,319
I noticed that my fingers started to get numb and cramp

177
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,359
My hands worked like a rake in the water
Not proper strokes

178
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,880
I wasn't in any pain but I was expecting it
Especially with the water being so cold

179
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,720
I had experienced this problem before
so I was expecting it

180
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,240
Then just keep going and going and going

181
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
It's very monotone

182
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
My body still felt OK

183
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
Food break at 7:32 hours and 26.6 kilometers

184
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Any cramps?

185
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,319
Fingers?

186
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,000
Do I have any gel left?

187
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,839
Yes

188
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Can I have it?

189
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,359
Is it this beacon?

190
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Go around that headland

191
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
To the right of that grove

192
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,680
Should we go in?

193
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,319
Straight in that way

194
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,319
I also bike for exercise

195
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,119
What I do is that I ride my bike to and from work
as often as possible, when the weather permits

196
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,519
And it is about 45 kilometers one way

197
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:31,799
Last year I rode 10,000 kilometers
from March until October

198
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Butterfly!

199
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,920
To the jetty?

200
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,559
The edge
The first log to the right

201
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,680
That was a mistake
Got cramps right away

202
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,839
Just before the finish I think that
Thomas Thor with his sense of humor

203
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:55,240
He told me to do butterfly strokes

204
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,680
Sure, after 30 kilometers I'll do some butterfly strokes

205
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,200
But I got cramps in my legs after one stroke

206
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
I don't mind

207
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,920
This is insane Andrzej!
What an amazing achievement!

208
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,519
Your hand on the wall

209
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,000
Karlsborg after 8:33 hours and 29.7 kilometers

210
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,240
Swim some more so we can get some photos

211
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,079
You are live on Facebook right now

212
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,759
Many people are congratulating you

213
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,680
Did you really paddle all the way?

214
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,039
Yes, Markus has been a great help

215
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,799
Andrzej, you will continue now up the canal?

216
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Thank you Markus

217
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,359
Thank you Thomas
Couldn't have made it without you

218
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,039
Thanks Peder

219
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,480
Impressed

220
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Continue up here now

221
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:31,119
I'll give you a push

222
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Do you want to see how you look?

223
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
I think it might be good to remember this

224
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
It's like a blue line there

225
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,079
It's amazing

226
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
The hardest part was the first 300 meters

227
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,839
It was excruciatingly cold
But I could not give up so quickly and go back

228
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,440
Was it cold at the start?

229
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,240
It was like 13 degrees

230
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
I questioned if I should keep going

231
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,720
15... 16....

232
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,720
Almost 17 here

233
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,680
18 here right at the end

234
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
It's alright
They will get better

235
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,759
You can see Motala over there
You can see the radio towers

236
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,680
Over there you can see the towers

237
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,880
The morning following his swim from Motala to Karlsborg
Andrzej went for a two kilometer swim in the outdoor pool

238
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,119
A few days later he continued with biking to and from work

239
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,480
A distance of 2 x 46 kilometers

240
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,880
He has yet to decide on his next challenge

241
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,920
In memory of my father
Lennart Hellberg 1945–2015

242
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,319
Who lived for film
